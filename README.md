## 📄 Project Overview
This repository documents my practice in Manual Software Testing using the **Swag Labs (SauceDemo)** e-commerce website. 

The goal is to demonstrate a structured approach to the **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**: from understanding requirements to executing test cases and reporting bugs. This project showcases my ability to work independently and maintain clear documentation.

Testing functional flows of an online store:
- **Smoke Testing** (Login functionality with different user roles)

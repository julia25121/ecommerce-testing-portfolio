## 📄 About this Project
This is my portfolio for Manual Software Testing. I used the **Swag Labs (SauceDemo)** website to practice my skills.

My goal is to show that I understand the full testing process (STLC). I wanted to demonstrate that I can:
* Read and understand requirements.
* Write clear test cases.
* Find and report bugs.
* Work independently.

## 🎯 What did I test?
I focused on the most important parts of an online store:
- **Login:** Checking if different users can sign in (Smoke Testing).
- **Shop Features:** Adding items to the cart, sorting products, and using filters.
- **Buying:** The full process of buying an item (End-to-End Testing).
- **UI/UX:** Checking if the site looks good and is easy to use.
